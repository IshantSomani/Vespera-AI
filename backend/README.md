# Vespera-AI Python Backend Project

This is a backend project built using **Flask** and various other dependencies. The project connects to a database (MongoDB) and uses machine learning models from **Hugging Face's Transformers** library.

## Requirements

This project requires several Python packages, which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. The `.env` file is used to securely store environment variables such as the database URI.

## Setting Up the Project

Follow the steps below to set up and run the backend project:

### 1. Clone the repository

If you haven't cloned the project yet, start by cloning it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IshantSomani/Vespera-AI-backend.git
cd Vespera-AI-backend
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

- For Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

- For macOS/Linux:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install the required dependencies

Once your virtual environment is activated, install the project dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the required libraries for the project.

### 4. Set up the `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory to store sensitive data like the MongoDB URI.

Example `.env` file content:

```plaintext
DATABASE_URI=mongodb://your_username:your_password@localhost:27017/your_database
```

Make sure to replace the `DATABASE_URI` with your actual MongoDB URI.

### 5. Run the Flask Application

Now that everything is set up, you can run the Flask application. The entry point is the `index.py` file or the `wsgi.py` file, depending on your setup.

To run the application, execute the following command:

```bash
python index.py
```

Alternatively, you can use `wsgi.py`:

```bash
python wsgi.py
```

This will start the Flask application, and you should see output indicating that the server is running, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### 6. Access the Application

Once the server is running, you can access the application by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser or using API tools like Postman.

### 7. Additional Notes

- Make sure your MongoDB server is running and accessible using the `DATABASE_URI` specified in the `.env` file.
- If you use any other external services or APIs (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers), ensure that you have proper API keys or authentication set up in your `.env` file.

## Project Structure Explanation

- **`app.py`**: Contains the main logic of the Flask application, including routes and database operations.
- **`wsgi.py`**: WSGI entry point for running the app with WSGI servers like Gunicorn or uWSGI.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A file that lists all the dependencies for the project.
- **`.env`**: A file to store environment variables, such as the database URI.

## Troubleshooting

- **ModuleNotFoundError**: If you encounter errors related to missing modules, try running `pip install -r requirements.txt` again to ensure all dependencies are installed.
- **Database connection issues**: Ensure your MongoDB server is running, and check that the `DATABASE_URI` in the `.env` file is correct.
